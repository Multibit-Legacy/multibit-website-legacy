  file as a backup for the wallet.</p>
<p>If something happened to your wallet and you want to recreate it do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new empty wallet.</li>
  <li>Import your private keys file using the 'Tools | <img width="16" height="16" title="Import private keys"
                                                            alt="Import private keys" src="img/importKey.png"/>&nbsp;Import

  </li>
  <li>MultiBit then adds the private keys from the file into the new wallet and replays the blockchain to get the
    transactions.
  </li>
</ol>
