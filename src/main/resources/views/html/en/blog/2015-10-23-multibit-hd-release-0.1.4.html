<h4>Increase in minimum mining transaction fee</h4>
<p>Bitcoin Core has recently raised the minimum fee a transaction must have for it to be relayed by the Bitcoin network. It has been raised from 1000 satoshi/KB to 5000 satoshi/KB.
  The minimum amount in the MultiBit HD fee slider has thus been adjusted upwards. All this fee goes to the miners.</p>

<h4>Semi-automatic update</h4>

<p>We normally wait 24 hours after a release and then activate the semi-automatic upgrade process. You decide if the upgrade occurs. The upgrade process will not affect your wallet data.
  Only the application binaries will be upgraded.</p>

<p>You can find more details, including digital signatures, on the <a href="/download.html">download page</a>.</p>
