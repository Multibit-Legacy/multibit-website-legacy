<h3>How to check digital signatures</h3>
<p><strong>Bitcoin applications are not like ordinary applications</strong> - they handle real money and as
  such need to be treated with more security precautions than you would otherwise use.</p>
<p>In order to combat malware all downloads provided by MultiBit are served over HTTPS and are cryptographically
  signed. This means that they cannot be altered without the alteration being detected.</p>
<p>In many cases simply acquiring the code direct from <code>multibit.org</code> over HTTPS will be sufficient
  security but we at MultiBit believe in going the extra mile to ensure that there is no doubt that what you think you
  have downloaded is exactly what we have published. To that end here is a short technical guide to verifying signatures
  using GPG.</p>
<p>This article is aimed at people who are comfortable with the command line but have not spent much time working
  with SHA1, GPG and so on. As usual commands are prefixed with either <code>></code> or <code>$</code> to show the
  typical command prompt for Windows or Unix.</p>

<p><a href="#Step 3">I have GPG installed and just want the specifics for MultiBit</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Step 1">Step 1 - SHA1 in action</h3>
<p>The first step on the road to security is access to strong cryptography. We'll start by creating a simple one line
  text file:</p>
<pre>
$ echo "Hello world" > example.txt
</pre>
<p>The above has an expected SHA1 hash of
  <code>33ab5639bfd8e7b95eb1d8d0b87781d4ffea4d5d</code> which we will now attempt to
  verify. Depending on your operating system you'll need to install a few applications in a particular order to
  establish a
  solid trust foundation.</p>
<h4>Windows - install FCIV</h4>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11533">Microsoft's File Checksum
  Integrity
  Verifier (FCIV)</a> is a command line tool that provides access to SHA1 checksums.</p>
<p>Once installed, you can test it out on your example file as follows</p>
<pre>
> fciv.exe -sha1 example.txt
</pre>
<p>You may find that the <code>example.txt</code> file contains the quotes surrounding the words and is likely stored
  using
  Windows line endings (CRLF) rather than Unix (LF). Avoiding this in Windows involves a fair bit of command line
  trickery
  so it is easier to simply edit the file manually to strip out the extra information and change the file save format to
  reach
  the quoted SHA1. While a hassle, this does prove that the SHA1 operation is correctly detecting the most minute of
  differences.</p>
<h4>Mac - use OpenSSL</h4>
<p>OS X ships with an older version of OpenSSL that supports SHA1. You may want to <a
  target="_blank" href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~aczeskis/openssl.html">update it</a>, but the standard version
  is good
  enough for our purposes.</p>
<pre>
$ openssl sha1 example.txt
</pre>

<h4>Linux - use SHA1 sum</h4>
<p>Most Linux distributions ship with the <code>sha1sum</code> utility.</p>
<pre>
$ sha1sum example.txt
</pre>

<h3 id="Step 2">Step 2 - Download and verify GPG</h3>
<p>At this point we have a way of verifying the integrity of anything we download, but we don't have any way to prove
  authenticity. Anyone could produce a copy of MultiBit containing malicious code with a valid SHA1 and it would pass
  our rather weak test. We need a cryptographic signature.</p>
<p>This is provided in the GnuPG (GPG) suite of applications that are
  <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/download/#auto-ref-3">available for download</a>. You can choose to use their binary
  installers but remember to verify what you have downloaded using the SHA1 process above.</p>
<p>For example after downloading the <a target="_blank" href="https://gpgtools.org/installer/index.html">GPG Tools
  installer</a> and
  clicking on the SHA1 link we can verify the following:</p>
<pre>
$ openssl sha1 GPGTools-2013.5.20.dmg
SHA1(GPGTools-2013.5.20.dmg)= 9f9fea935b3ce90d8d04542a754b8778f82a8b1b
</pre>
<p>To verify that GPG is installed and working use the following:</p>
<pre>
gpg --version
</pre>
<p>The result should look something like this:</p>
<pre>
gpg (GnuPG/MacGPG2) 2.0.17
libgcrypt 1.4.6
... more info ...
</pre>
<p>After you have verified GPG you can then use GPG itself to verify all future GPG updates using the process
  described next.</p>

<h3 id="Step 3">Step 3 - Download and verify MultiBit</h3>
<p>On startup MultiBit will check with the main site to verify that it is still the latest released version. If
  not then it will present a dialog to inform the user and open a browser window to assist the download process.</p>

<h4>Import Jim's public key</h4>
<p>The typical process is to simply click on the installer package link for your operating system and go through
  the installation wizard. In this case we're going to actually use the digital signature provided by MultiBit to
  verify that the download has been signed by the lead developer Jim Burton.</p>
<p>We import Jim's public key (<a target="_blank"
                                  href="http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?search=0x79F7C572">0x79F7C572</a>
  ) using the following command:</p>
<pre>
$ gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 0x79F7C572
gpg: requesting key 79F7C572 from hkp server pgp.mit.edu
gpg: key 79F7C572: "Jim Burton (multibit.org developer) &lt;jim618@fastmail.co.uk&gt;" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
</pre>
<p>Each public key has a unique number which has been provided on the main MultiBit website. As more people decide
  to sign the MultiBit release then more keys will be presented on the site. By importing the key you give GPG the
  opportunity to check that the key has not been revoked, it also means that you can now send the owner of the key
  encrypted messages.</p>
<h4>Verify the installer signature</h4>
<p>We are now ready to verify the MultiBit installer signature. From <a href="https://multibit.org" target="_blank">the
  front page</a>, locate the "Signature" link beside the installer for your operating system and use ("Save As").
  This will download the signature file to the same location as the installer and it has a <code>.asc</code>
  extension (for "armoured ASCII").</p>
<p>You can now issue the verification command. The example below is for a version 0.5.13 Mac installer.</p>
<pre>
$ gpg --verify multibit-0.5.13.dmg.asc
gpg: Signature made Mon 22 Jul 10:07:09 2013 BST using RSA key ID 23F7FB7B
gpg: Good signature from "Jim Burton (multibit.org developer) &lt;jim618@fastmail.co.uk&gt;"
</pre>
<p>You may see the following additional information:</p>
<pre>
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 299C 423C 672F 47F4 756A  6BA4 C197 2AED 79F7 C572
Subkey fingerprint: 4A71 A836 F572 01B4 D088  7D60 0820 A658 23F7 FB7B
</pre>
<p>This warning from GPG is to inform you that you don't trust any keys that have signed Jim's key. As more people sign
  Jim's key eventually you will encounter someone whose key you do trust and that will in turn validate Jim's key in
  your trust chain. If you want to trust this key immediately you must sign it with your own key. Full information
  about key signing, and other features of GPG <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html">is
    available here</a>.</p>
<h3>Final notes</h3>
<p>The use of cryptographic signatures provides a guarantee that what you think you have downloaded is actually
  present on your system. <strong>Bitcoin applications are not like ordinary applications</strong> - they handle real
  money and as
  such need to be treated with more security precautions than you would otherwise use. It is always worth learning
  more about the technology you use and hopefully this article has given you a taste.</p>
