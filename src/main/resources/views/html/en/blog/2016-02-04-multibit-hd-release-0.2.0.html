      <p>Many people have asked us for the ability to buy and sell bitcoin easily from MultiBit HD and after careful consideration we have selected Glidera as our partner
      of choice to fulfil this feature. At the time of writing (Q1 2016) Glidera have strong coverage in the USA and Canada with more regions planned in the coming year.</p>
      <p>As with all regulated financial services managing transactions in national currencies you will need to verify your identity during their account set up, but this
      information is not passed to MultiBit in any way. For more information, <a href="/en/help/hd0.2/buy-sell-bitcoin.html">please refer to the Buy/Sell bitcoin help article</a>.

<h4>News reader</h4>
<p>Although we maintain an Atom feed (see link at the foot of the page) many users have expressed an interest in having a basic news alerter directly within the application so that
  they can be kept up to date with developments. For more information, <a href="/en/help/hd0.2/news.html">please refer to the News help article</a>.</p>

<h4>Semi-automatic update</h4>

<p>We normally wait 24 hours after a release and then activate the semi-automatic upgrade process. You decide if the upgrade occurs. The upgrade process will not affect your wallet data.
  Only the application binaries will be upgraded.</p>

<p>You can find more details, including digital signatures, on the <a href="/download.html">download page</a>.</p>
