<h3>MultiBit Classic is four years old today</h3>

<p>On 16 July 2011 Jim pushed <a href="https://github.com/jim618/multibit/commit/75fb14dcaf4c1dc96732cd876d7aadc7736222ee" target="_blank">the first commit</a>
  of the MultiBit source code to GitHub. This marked the beginning of a long journey as part of the Bitcoin ecosystem which we would like to share with you today.</p>

<h4>How did it all begin ?</h4>

<p>On the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bitcoinj/Dq1N3oMFl8c/esRyfmha1cUJ" target="_blank">Bitcoinj mailing list</a>. Jim provided a link to a
Google Doc containing an initial proposal for a user interface to the growing bitcoinj library. After some discussion it became a standlone client living in its own project that used bitcoinj to access the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>Shortly after that Jim and I (Gary) collaborated on the user interface document and
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bitcoinj/Dq1N3oMFl8c/PKNwx2L7XiEJ" target="_blank">MultiBit was born</a>.</p>

<p>At that time there was no website but a couple of months later the Wayback machine took this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110923170742/http://multibit.org/">snapshot</a>
 of the website. It was pretty basic.</p>

<h4>Giving thanks</h4>

<p>MultiBit probably would not exist without the support of other people in the Bitcoin ecosystem. We want to thank all the people who donated their time and
  energy in various ways over the last four years to MultiBit. This includes donors to our donation address, localisers who translated MultiBit into dozens of languages and especially to the other
  bitcoinj devs who have built the bitcoinj library to be the thoroughbred it is today.</p>

<h4>Where do we go now ?</h4>

<p>MultiBit Classic will continue to be supported in maintenance mode. We will issue occasional updates to ensure compatibility with modern operating
  systems and apply critical security fixes. So while we do not think we will ever truly retire Classic it will no longer be the popular
  choice it once was and will be largely confined to more technical users of Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has changed a lot in the past 4 years and <a href="https://multibit.org">MultiBit HD</a> is now the better choice for
  our users now. Much of the tried and tested Classic code lives on in HD under the covers and when coupled with the extensive improvements
  and new features of HD it is a worthy upgrade. Try it out and see if you like it.</p>

<p>Every year Bitcoin moves on and becomes more sophisticated so it will be fascinating to see where we will be in another 4 years.</p>
