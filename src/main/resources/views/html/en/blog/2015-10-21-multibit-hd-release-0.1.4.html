<p>This release adds support for the <a href="https://www.keepkey.com" title="KeepKey hardware wallet" target="_blank">KeepKey</a> hardware wallet.</p>

<h4>Summary of changes</h4>
<p>Here is a quick summary of the changes contained in this release:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support added for KeepKey hardware wallet - simply plug it in to use it</li>
  <li>The minimum mining transaction fee has been raised to 5000 satoshi/KB (following the same change in Bitcoin Core)</li>

</ul>

<h4>KeepKey support</h4>
<p>You can now use your KeepKey hardware wallet in MultiBit HD. It works very similarly to a <a href="https://bitcointrezor.com" title="Trezor" target="_blank">Trezor</a> hardware wallet. You can use it to sign your Bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p>Here is a YouTube video of how you can use your KeepKey with MultiBit HD:</p>

<h4>Increase in minimum mining transaction fee</h4>
<p>Bitcoin Core has recently raised the minimum fee a transaction must have for it to be relayed by the Bitcoin network. It has been raised from 1000 satoshi/KB to 5000 satoshi/KB.
  The minimum amount in the MultiBit HD fee slider has thus been adjusted upwards. All this fee goes to the miners.</p>

<h4>Semi-automatic update</h4>

<p>We normally wait 24 hours after a release and then activate the semi-automatic upgrade process. You decide if the upgrade occurs. The upgrade process will not affect your wallet data. Only the application binaries will be upgraded.</p>

<p>You can find more details, including digital signatures, on the <a href="/download.html">download page</a>.</p>
