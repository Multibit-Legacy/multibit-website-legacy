<h3>MultiBit HD Release 0.3.0 is now available</h3>

<p>We are pleased to announce the next <a href="/index.html">MultiBit HD release (0.3.0) is available for download.</a></p>

<p>This release removes our fee collecting mechanism generally known as BRIT and provides a range of bug fixes.</p>

<h4>Summary of changes</h4>
<p>Here is a quick summary of the changes contained in this release:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove BRIT and all related code - see later for details</li>
  <li>Change to the software licence agreement - it's now pure MIT licence</li>
  <li>Various user interface fixes</li>
  <li>Localisation refresh</li>
  <li>Various small bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Removing BRIT</h4>

<p>After running the BRIT experiment for almost 2 years we have decided that it has been an economic failure and have taken steps to remove it from MultiBit HD version 0.3.0
  onwards.</p>

<p>Our initial hopes were that this technique of charging users a tiny amount would provide a sufficient income to support the ongoing development costs of MultiBit HD with
  enough left over to enable us to distribute some of that income upstream to the projects that we depend upon (Bitcoinj, XChange and so on). Unfortunately despite a steadily
increasing user base the level of income generated is too small to realise those hopes.</p>

<p>If you have recently upgraded to 0.3.0 you may notice a small increase in your wallet balance as pending BRIT fees are now included in your overall spendable balance.</p>

<p>We hope that by removing this fee mechanism, leaving only the usual miner's fees present in all wallets, that our users still on Classic will
  <a href="/en/help/hd0.1/how-to-upgrade-from-classic.html">take this opportunity to upgrade to MultiBit HD</a> since there is no significant cost in doing so and significant
  improvements in security and user experience.</p>

<p>We will leave the <a href="" target="_blank">source code to BRIT</a> on GitHub for those who may be interested in how it worked. All operational code has been removed from
  MultiBit HD and there will be no replacement for it in the future. MultiBit HD will now follow the same optional donation model as MultiBit Classic.</p>

<h4>Pure MIT licence</h4>

<p>As a result of the BRIT removal there is no longer a need for you to agree to a licence. The MIT licence confers upon you all rights to the source code without restriction
and so there is no practical need for you to agree to any terms and conditions prior to downloading or using the software. Consequently the website and first use of the wallet
have been simplified.</p>

<h4>Semi-automatic update</h4>

<p>We normally wait 24 hours after a release and then activate the semi-automatic upgrade process. You decide if the upgrade occurs. The upgrade process will not affect your wallet data.
  Only the application binaries will be upgraded.</p>

<p>You can find more details, including digital signatures, on the <a href="/download.html">download page</a>.</p>
