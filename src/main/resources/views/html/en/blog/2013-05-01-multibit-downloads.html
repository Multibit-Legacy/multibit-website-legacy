<h1>MultiBit downloads for April 2013</h1>
<p>TL;DR There were an estimated <b>73,200+</b> downloads of MultiBit in April 2013.</p>
<br>
<p>Estimating the number of downloads of MultiBit for April 2013 is not obvious so I thought I'd write up the methodology I have used.</p>
<p>The source data is <a href="https://multibit.org/awstats/awstats.pl?config=multibit.org">here</a>.</p>
<p>Normally to estimate the number of downloads I take the total bandwidth used by all the installers, DMG files, exes and jars and divide by the largest installer, which is the windows one. This should be a conservative estimate. I don't use the click counts as people use download managers and can start and stop the downloads. These bump up the click counts.</p>
<p>In April the size of the installers was reduced dramatically for the 0.5.9x code - to about 10MB from about 30MB.</p>
<p> So:</p>
<ol>
   <li><p>Total GB downloaded on installers etc in April : 1847.81 GB.</p></li>
   <li><p>This comprised: 129.88 GB of version 0.5.9 code and 1717.93 GB of other versions.</p></li>
   <li><p>Max size of 0.5.9 code = 10.6 MB => there were about 129.88 * 1024 / 10.6 downloads of 0.5.9 code = 12546 downloads.</p></li>
   <li><p>Max size of other code = 29 MB => there were about (1847.81 - 129.88) * 1024 / 29 downloads of other versions = 60,660 downloads.</p></li>
   <li><p>Thus the total MultiBit downloads for April 2013 = 12546 + 60,660 = <b>73,200+ downloads</b>. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>For reference the earlier months' download figures were: Jan : 4600,  Feb : 8,800,  Mar : 26,000</p>
