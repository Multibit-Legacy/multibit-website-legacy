<h4>Background</h4>

<p>Using the experience gained from the creation of MultiBit Classic we have been working full time on producing a wallet that makes Bitcoin accessible
for ordinary mainstream users. Our mission was to remove as much complexity and unnecessary functionality as possible leaving only
what is essential for a normal user of Bitcoin. We think that MultiBit HD achieves that goal.</p>

<p>We decided very early on to integrate support for the Trezor hardware wallet as it ensures a safe place to store private keys while
still allowing for a smooth user experience when spending occurs.</p>

<p>This software is beta so remember to only use it with small amounts of bitcoin at this stage.</p>

<h4>Next steps</h4>

<p>Our next goal is to reach Release 1 which will have support for Payment Protocol (BIP70) among other useful features. If you want
to keep an eye on progress, please "watch" our GitHub repository and use the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-solutions/multibit-hd/milestones" target="_blank">Release 0.1 milestone</a>.
