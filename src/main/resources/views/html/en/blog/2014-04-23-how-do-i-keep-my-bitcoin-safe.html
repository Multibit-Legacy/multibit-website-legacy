<h1>How do I keep my bitcoin safe?</h1>

<h3>Short answer: By keeping your private keys safe.</h3>

<p>Ownership of bitcoins is transferred in plain sight on the blockchain.  What makes bitcoins yours is that the only person who knows  the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key" target="_blank">private key</a> to the address credited with the bitcoins, is you.  As soon as anyone else knows that private key, its address (and all its bitcoins) effectively belong to them too.  Unlike a bank account, a bitcoin address doesn't belong to a named person.  The address belongs to whoever knows its private key, a bit like cash belongs to whoever is physically holding it.</p>  

<p>Wallet software typically creates private keys (to empty addresses) and keeps the keys behind the scenes.  When you want to spend your bitcoins, all your wallet typically asks you is "Pay who?" and "Pay how much?"  The wallet takes care of constructing a valid electronic message (a "transaction") and sends the transaction to the Bitcoin network.  The transaction is like an irreversible bank cheque.  It orders a reallocation of bitcoins from your address to some other address.  To be valid, the transaction has a "signature" which proves it came from someone who knew the private key.</p>

<p>I.e. the private key is necessary for you to move any of your bitcoins from an address.  You must keep the private key safe.</p>
  
<p>But the flip side is that a private key is like an easy-to-copy house key that has the house address clearly stamped on it.  The private key enables anyone who knows it instantly to find out what address it unlocks, and to move all the bitcoins from that address.  Knowing the private key is sufficient for anyone to take all of your bitcoins.   Unlike the password to a bank account, the private key can't be reset. You must keep the private key secret.</p>
   
<h3>So how do I keep my private keys both secret and safe?</h3>

<p>You need to decide for yourself, based on what you are happy to trust.  You can:
<ul>
<li>Keep your keys on a local wallet like Multibit Classic, trusting your own computer's security, your software's file management (and yourself not to lose your <a href="../../../../../en/help/v0.5/help_lostOrForgottenPassword.html">passwords</a> or <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-25134289" target="_blank">computer</a>).</li> 
<li>Keep your keys on a hosted wallet, trusting a third party.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Paper_wallet" target="_blank">Create your own keys and keep them on a piece of paper</a>, trusting yourself to generate random keys and keep the paper secret and safe.</li>
<li>Generate your keys afresh from a deterministic algorithm (e.g. with <a href="../../../../blog/2014/03/26/multibit-hd-welcome-wizard.html">Multibit HD</a>) seeded by random words, trusting yourself to keep the words secret and safe, and trusting the software's key calculator.</li>
</ul>
