<h1>MultiBit HD Sneak Preview</h1>

<p>We've been asked quite a few times about progress with MultiBit HD, the replacement for the current MultiBit Classic.
  To show that we're hard at work for the Bitcoin community here is a sneak preview of MultiBit HD and some of its many
  features. If you'd like to join in with testing (and get your name on the contributors list) please
  <a href="http://bitcoin-solutions.co.uk/contact.html" target="_blank">get in touch through our contact page</a>.

<p>The above shows the wallet detail screen with some payments going on. As those familiar with MultiBit Classic can
  tell, we have completely redesigned the user interface to modernise it without making it too different. If you
  don't like the "light" theme shown, you can always switch to the "dark" theme for low light conditions.</p>
<p>Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets do a great job of hiding away the mechanics of Bitcoin and promote the
  idea of multiple "accounts" arranged in a similar manner to files and folders in a standard desktop. By having the
  sidebar follow this metaphor we can provide support for multiple nested accounts (which can be synchronized with
  other wallets compatible with BIP32/39 standards). It also allows us to support hardware wallets such as the Trezor.

<p>Everybody has a different way of wanting to display their balances and this is especially true when dealing
  with different countries and languages. Users of MultiBit HD can now fine tune their own display to exactly
  match what they want. Support is in place for millis, mikes and satoshis along with different presentation styles
  including the icon, "BTC", "XBT" and "XUB" (equivalent to a micro-bitcoin).</p>

  the translation project, and <strong>earn some coins for your trouble</strong>, please <a

  your chosen language using the contact page linked above.</p>

<p>Next week we'll post up some more detail about managing split payments where you request payment but only get it
  in parts.</p>
