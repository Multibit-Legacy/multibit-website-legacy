<h3>MultiBit and Denial of Service attacks</h3>

<p>Over the past few months we at MultiBit have noticed a few Denial of Service (DoS) attacks taking place against our servers.</p>

<p>While this hasn't affected our delivery of the MultiBit application to our users, we think it is important to remind the Bitcoin community that MultiBit is a standalone application that only relies on the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>If our website went down it would have no effect on your installed copy of MultiBit to send and receive bitcoins. Once you download MultiBit you are no longer dependent on our site (except for the internal help files) and have full ownership and control over your bitcoins.</p>

<p>We can't ever know the motivations of people initiating a DoS attack - but we do have a theory. Given the recent history of
  price manipulation based on similar techniques it seems plausible that the attackers think that taking down
  the MultiBit website would prevent the MultiBit application from working, thus attracting bad news headlines and driving the price down.</p>

<p>As you can see this is not the case.</p>

<p>We would like to thank all of our users for their continued use of MultiBit and to give a reminder about the upcoming MultiBit&nbsp;HD which will be a significant upgrade.</p>
