<h3>KeepKey LLC is buying MultiBit</h3>

<p>The MultiBit team is pleased to announce that KeepKey LLC, makers of the popular KeepKey hardware wallet, have put in an offer to buy MultiBit which has been accepted. Within a few weeks we will complete the transfer of control over the MultiBit code and website to them and we will step back from further development.</p>

<h4>How does this affect me ?</h4>
<p>MultiBit HD users will be largely unaffected once KeepKey take over the MultiBit website and code base. The most visible difference will be that the MultiBit HD installers will no longer be signed by Jim Burton and instead be signed by KeepKey LLC. This will also include new PGP signatures for new releases. This change will occur at the next upgrade.</p>
<p>KeepKey are committed to maintaining MultiBit HD as an open source MIT licence project going forward. They are of the same mind as us regarding MultiBit Classic which has reached its end of life. We strongly urge anyone still remaining on Classic to migrate to HD as soon as possible.</p>

<h4>Credits and thanks</h4>
<p>The existing MultiBit team have been developing, releasing and supporting MultiBit HD and Classic since 2011. We would like to thank the many developers and localisers that have contributed their efforts to the MultiBit project over the years.</p>
<p>Developing MultiBit has been a fascinating experience for both of us, but we feel that it is now time to move on to other projects. We are happy to have found a new home for MultiBit and are looking forward to KeepKey continuing the projectâ€™s journey.</p>
<p>We wish them all the best !</p>
