<h1>What is Bitcoin all about ?</h1>

<p>Bitcoin is one of the first implementations of a concept called crypto-currency, which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list.
  Building upon the notion that money is any object, or any sort of record, accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country
  or socio-economic context, Bitcoin is designed around the idea of using cryptography to control the creation and transfer of money,
  <strong>rather than relying on
    central authorities</strong>. </p>
<p>In 2009, the first Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was published in a Cryptography mailing list by a member under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto.
  Towards the end of 2010 Satoshi left the project saying he had moved on to other things. The creator of Bitcoin never revealed his identity and simply left his
  invention to the world. The origin and the motivation behind Bitcoin is still today a great source of mystery.</p>
<p>Since 2010, the Bitcoin community has grown with many developers working on the project. During June and July 2011, Bitcoin suddenly gained media attention
  leading to a massive buy rally. The resulting bubble slowly deflated through the latter part of 2011 and the value of Bitcoin has since slowly climbed once
  again back to its 2011 heights.</p>
<p>On September 27th 2012, the Bitcoin Foundation was created in an effort to standardize, protect, and promote Bitcoin. Today, the Bitcoin economy is developing quickly with new users joining every day.</p>
<p>From the end of 2012 and continuing into 2013, several well-known websites announced that they would accept Bitcoin in addition to other payment mechanisms. This
  had the effect of significantly raising awareness of Bitcoin which many had written off as a failed endeavour.</p>

<h1>Why do we need Bitcoin ?</h1>
<p>There is a fundamental mismatch between our traditional payment systems and our Internet experience. In the early days of the Internet it was nearly impossible to buy
anything because there was no suitable way to transmit value to an arbitrary location. Seeing a huge opportunity the credit card companies, and later PayPal, stepped up and created a workaround where they acted as a trusted third party. The merchants pay a fee to be able to receive payments from their
customers using the credit card and PayPal services. They have no real choice in the matter because there is no alternative.</p>
<p>Enter Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is needed to improve trade between people. It provides merchants, and individuals, with a way to be able to transmit value to an arbitrary location
that dovetails perfectly with the way that the Internet works. You can send as much, or as little as you like. You are only charged to send and the fee is often close to zero.</p> 

<h1>Can you briefly describe what it does ?</h1>
<p>Here is a short summary of Bitcoin's features:</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>Transactions are irreversible. It is like digital cash so there is no chargeback risk.</li>
  <li>Transactions are broadcast within seconds and
    <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/FAQ#Why_do_I_have_to_wait_10_minutes_before_I_can_spend_money_I_received.3F" target="_blank">verified within 10 to 60 minutes</a>. Zero confirmations are fine for low value items, wait for 6 confirmations if you're selling a house. 
  </li>
  <li>Transactions can be received at any time regardless of whether your computer is turned on or off.</li>
  <li>Transaction processing and money issuance are carried out collectively through
    <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining">mining</a>. Regular users do not need to know how mining works to use Bitcoin.
  </li>
  <li>Bitcoins can be transferred between arbitrary nodes on the network.</li>
  <li>Double spending is prevented by using a
    <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain" target="_blank">block chain</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Access to bitcoins is controlled through your private keys that are simply numbers so are easily stored. Without your private key no-one can steal your bitcoins.</li>
  <li>You don't have to register with anyone to send or receive bitcoins.</li>
</ul>

<h1>What limits are there ?</h1>
<p>Bitcoin is a protocol in the same way that HTTP is a protocol. When it was started certain values were chosen by its founder (Satoshi) to represent hard limits and rules.
  These limits and rules are enforced collectively by the network. While they will not change for Bitcoin, other digital currencies using the same technology may change
  them to suit their needs.</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>Hard limit of
    <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_Currency_Supply" target="_blank">about 21 million Bitcoins</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Bitcoins are divisible to 8 decimal places yielding a total of approx. 21×10<sup>14</sup> currency units (2.1 quadrillion).
  </li>
  <li>Transactions are cheap, and <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_fees" target="_blank">mostly free</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>How big is Bitcoin now ?</h1>
<p>The network has been running for more than 45 months, yielding some impressive security features. There has been especially significant growth over the last year.
  As of February 2013, here are some statistics.</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>Long block chain (more than 220,000 blocks).</li>
  <li>A lot of processing power securing transactions - estimated at over 25 terahashes/s.</li>
  <li>Over $1 million USD of daily trade volume distributed across 40,000 transactions.</li>
  <li>Total value of all Bitcoins in circulation is over $300 million.</li>
  <li>Only one major
    <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Incidents#Value_overflow" target="_blank">security incident</a> (fixed in August 2010).
  </li>
</ul>
