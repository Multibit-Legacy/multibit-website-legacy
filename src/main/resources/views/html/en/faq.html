<h3>Hi! I'm new to this Bitcoin thing. I'm not technically minded but I want to know how it all works. Can you explain it to me ?</h3>

<p>Sure, ask away. Bear in mind that there is a lot to learn.</p>

<h3>What is it ?</h3>

<p>Put very simply it is a new form of money that works extremely well on the Internet.</p>

<h3>So it's a "virtual currency" ?</h3>

<p>No. Virtual currencies are generally tokens issued by a company for near-exclusive use on their site.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a general purpose digital currency. It is programmable money.</p>

<p>Nothing like Bitcoin has ever existed before.</p>

<h3>What's the difference between Bitcoin and bitcoin ?</h3>

<p>The Bitcoin network has a capital "B", while the tokens that represent money are called bitcoins with a small "b".</p>

<h3>Does it have its own currency symbol ?</h3>

<p>There is no formal symbol at the time of writing, but the leading one is a B with two vertical strokes present in Font Awesome. The three-letter code is currently BTC but many believe that it will finally become XBT in the future since that is the most appropriate ISO 4217 name.</p>

<h3>Who owns it ?</h3>

<p>It is not owned or controlled by anyone. There is no government or corporation running it. Regardless, it now being used by millions of people all over the world to conduct transactions.</p>

<h3>If no-one owns it, how can I trust it ?</h3>

<p>When you log in to a website your user name and password are protected using cryptography - a very advanced branch of mathematics that protects secrets.</p>

<p>Bitcoin uses cryptography to undeniably prove to others that you, and only you, have the right to spend the funds under your control.</p>

<p>In short, if you trust mathematics, you can trust Bitcoin.</p>

<h3>So I can send money to anyone on the Internet ?</h3>

<p>Yes. You don't even have to know who they are.</p>

<h3>Does that mean I need a Bitcoin email address or something ?</h3>

<p>Almost. When you want to receive money you would typically provide a Bitcoin address. It is a long mess of letters and numbers that starts with either a 1 or a 3. Here's an example:</p>

<pre>1AhN6rPdrMuKBGFDKR1k9A8SCLYaNgXhty</pre>

<h3>I'm not typing all that in !</h3>

<p>You don't have to. That's the job of your Bitcoin wallet. It looks after all your addresses in the same way that your email software keeps track of all your friend's email addresses.</p>

<h3>So I have more than one Bitcoin address ?</h3>

<p>Yes. The most private way to use Bitcoin is to never re-use an address. Your Bitcoin wallet will take care of this for you.</p>

<h3>And where do I get this wallet software ?</h3>

<p>Bitcoin is available for everyone. You can find Bitcoin wallets for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iPhone and pretty much everything else.</p>

<h3>You talk about privacy but I'll still have to sign up to use it</h3>

<p>Some wallet providers will ask you to sign up, others don't.</p>

<p>It is not a requirement of Bitcoin that you reveal your identity. In fact one of the prime goals of Bitcoin is to avoid revealing your identity to anyone, but still allow you to conduct a transaction. It is very like cash in that sense.</p>

<h3>So it's completely anonymous ?</h3>

<p>No. It is possible for someone with significant dedicated resources (governments, police agencies etc) to track your transactions by examining the public blockchain.</p>

<p>Overall, its anonymity is much closer to cash than to a credit card.</p>

<h3>What's the "blockchain" ?</h3>

<p>It is the large database that contains all the transactions ever made using Bitcoin. New transactions are gathered up into a group called a block. Each new block references the one before forming a chain.</p>

<p>At present the blockchain is about 12Gb and growing every 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>I'm not downloading that !</h3>

<p>You don't have to. As a normal user of Bitcoin you are only interested in the parts of the blockchain that contain your transactions. That small portion is about 25Mb.</p>

<h3>So what type of user would want to download the full blockchain ?</h3>

<p>Normally people running websites that accept Bitcoin - merchants - would make sure they maintain a complete copy of the blockchain to avoid doublespends.</p>

<h3>Er, "doublespends" ?</h3>

<p>That is where you get to spend the same money twice with different people. It was a common problem with digital money before Bitcoin solved it.</p>

<h3>The "blockchain" prevents "doublespends". You'd better explain...</h3>

<p>In the past there have been many attempts at making digital money. They have all failed because they all required trust in someone. Usually this was a company or government that checked all the transactions going through their system to ensure that no-one was doublespending.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem was trusting the central checker. What if it was cracked and all the transactions rewritten? What if the central checker itself wanted to fake a crack in order to cover something up?</p>

<h3>So if a single centralised checker is bad then what about having lots of independent checkers?</h3>

<p>That's what Bitcoin does. Everyone who downloads the full blockchain is contributing to the overall security of the blockchain. Everyone is continuously checking everyone else. Nobody trusts anyone, but everyone trusts the mathematics.</p>

<h3>So Bitcoin is sort of like BitTorrent then ?</h3>

<p>Yes. It uses a very similar approach to sharing the big database file that is the blockchain. Anyone running the Bitcoin software is known as a node or peer.</p>

<h3>Got it. Wait... if nobody trusts anyone who chooses the blocks ?</h3>

<p>Anyone can offer up a block for acceptance by the Bitcoin network. To create blocks you simply run some software called a Bitcoin miner. If your block is accepted you get a reward.</p>

<h3>Could you briefly explain the rules for getting a block accepted ?</h3>

<p>Sure. To get a block accepted you have to prove that you have checked all the transactions in it are valid and that you have expended a certain amount of effort in securing it.</p>

<h3>How is a block secured ?</h3>

<p>Bitcoin uses cryptography to create a number that is unique to the block. It is impossible to know in advance what the number will be since even the slightest change in the block will produce a completely different number.</p>

<p>The task facing a Bitcoin miner is to fiddle with the block, without altering the integrity of the transactions, until that number is below a given target.</p>

<p>The lower the target, the greater the difficulty.</p>

<p>For the technically minded, a Bitcoin miner has to find a SHA256 hash that is under the target value.</p>

<h3>I'm not technical - why do we have this target ?</h3>

<p>Remember that there are millions of computers out there running Bitcoin mining software. They are all in competition with each other trying to get their blocks accepted so that they can claim their reward.</p>

<p>If there was no target then there would be millions of blocks all being offered up and it would be very easy to include doublespends.</p>

<h3>So "miners" secure blocks which in turn secure transactions ?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h3>You mentioned a reward ?</h3>

<p>Yes. Once a miner has secured a block, they send it to other nodes in the Bitcoin network for verification. It is trivial to verify that the target has been achieved and that all the transactions have not been tampered with.</p>

<p>This proves that the original miner put some effort into securing the block and qualifies for their reward. This reward is called the coinbase and it is the only way
that new bitcoins can be minted.</p>

<p>The other miners then continue gathering transactions and grouping them into a new block which they will later link to this one.</p>

<h3>So it's called "mining" because you're digging up bitcoins ?</h3>

<p>That's the analogy. You could extend it a little to say that Bitcoin is a digital element that is rarer than gold.</p>

<h3>Rarer than gold ?</h3>

<p>Yes. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins produced and they only exist here on Earth. It will take until about the year 2140 to get them all.</p>

<p>Gold is present all over the Universe. All it takes to find more is to go up into space and get it.</p>

<h3>21 million isn't enough for any decent sized economy...</h3>

<p>Quite so. Fortunately bitcoins are infinitely divisible since they are merely numbers. At present the Bitcoin network keeps track of them to 8 decimal places.</p>

<p>Thus the total number of units in the Bitcoin system is 2.1 quadrillion (2,100 trillion) which is enough for the global cash economy.</p>

<p>Of course, even a fraction of a single bitcoin is sufficient since it is infinitely divisible.</p>

<h3>OK, we got sidetracked. What if two or more blocks are secured at the same time. Who wins ?</h3>

<p>Since everyone is in competition with everyone else there could be multiple competing blocks being built. The rule is that the Bitcoin network will always accept the longest chain with the highest difficulty level as the final answer.</p>

<h3>What happens to the transactions on the losing chain ?</h3>

<p>Blocks that are no longer on the longest chain are called orphaned blocks. The transactions that are contained within them are no longer considered to be valid and are dropped from the Bitcoin network.</p>

<h3>Wait, what - the transaction is lost ?</h3>

<p>Yes, in the worst case scenario. However, it is much more likely that the transaction has been copied into a block on the longer chain.</p>

<h3>So if transactions might be lost in the race how can I be sure that I've got my money ?</h3>

<p>While there is a lot of activity at the head of the blockchain it very rapidly decreases the older a block gets. By the time a block is 6 layers deep into the blockchain it can be considered to be irreversible.</p>

<p>We call each layer a "confirmation" since a miner has verified the block and then built upon it.</p>

<h3>How long does it take to get these confirmations ?</h3>

<p>Typically each confirmation takes about 10 minutes. Therefore in about an hour any transaction is irreversible.</p>

<h3>You've said "irreversible" twice now - surely if I make a mistake I can phone someone ?</h3>

<p>No. Bitcoin is very like cash. Once you've spent it that's it.</p>

<p>There is nobody with whom you can file a complaint to get your money back. If it were possible to undo a transaction it would undermine the security of the entire Bitcoin network.</p>

<h3>Hmm. No chargebacks has got to be good for merchants...</h3>

<p>Yes. With Bitcoin a merchant gets paid within an hour for their goods and services. If the merchant is willing to reduce the number of confirmations (such as with low value items) then they can get their money quicker.</p>

<p>Credit cards often keep the possibility of chargebacks open for 180 days leading to uncertainty with cashflow so Bitcoin definitely helps merchants.</p>

<h3>Ah, but surely there's a fee ?</h3>

<p>Yes. It is called the "miner's fee" and it is used to pay for the securing and eternal storage of your transaction across millions of computers on the Internet.</p>

<p>It is only paid when spending bitcoins, not to receive.</p>

<p>Currently it is 0.1mXBT which is less than 0.1 USD. The fee is generally fixed for simple transactions so doesn't increase with the amount of bitcoins.</p>

<h3>I'm really not technical - what is 0.1mXBT ?</h3>

<p>Bitcoin uses the metric system to denote amounts. 1mXBT is a thousandth of a bitcoin and is called a milli (like millimeter). 1uXBT is a millionth of a bitcoin and is called a mike (like micrometer).</p>

<p>The smallest unit (remember the 8 decimal places) is called a Satoshi after the inventor of Bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>

<h3>You're sidetracking again. What if a merchant goes bad ?</h3>

<p>Sorry. Most well established businesses are looking for repeat business so are not trying to defraud you. That said, "buyer beware" is the key phrase when dealing with any online merchant.</p>

<p>Virtually all countries with access to the Internet have laws that protect consumers from unfair business practices. Often representation under those laws is free through some kind of Trading Standards department.</p>

<h3>Yeah, like I'm going to bother with that...</h3>

<p>Well then, that brings me to something very interesting about Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Recall at the start I mentioned that Bitcoin is "programmable money". This means that Bitcoin transactions can be created that go beyond the usual "pay this much to that address".</p>

<p>Before I can explain you'll need to know more about transactions.</p>

<h3>I think this is about to get really hard...</h3>

<p>Let's take it step by step.</p>

<p>Clearly a transaction is simply someone sending money somewhere. The transaction says "pay this much bitcoin to this address authorised by me".</p>

<h3>Wait, how do I know that you have any bitcoin at all ?</h3>

<p>From previous transactions that have been paid to me in earlier confirmed blocks.</p>

<h3>So each transaction has a parent and so on ?</h3>

<p>Yes. The sum of all bitcoins paid into Bitcoin addresses that you own is your total balance.</p>

<h3>OK, makes sense. How do I prove that I own those addresses and not anyone else ?</h3>

<p>For that you need to know a little more cryptography - specifically something called public and private keys.</p>

<h3>You've completely lost me.</h3>

<p>Here's a quick overview of the principle.</p>

<ol>
  <li>You want me to send you a diamond through the post.</li>
  <li>You send me an empty metal box containing an unlocked padlock.</li>
  <li>I put the diamond in the box. I also put my own unlocked padlock in there. Then I lock the box with your padlock.</li>
  <li>Now nobody can open that box except you so I send it through the post.</li>
  <li>It arrives and you use your private key to open your lock.</li>
  <li>You examine the diamond, and you want to send me payment (in cash) so you put the pile of notes in the box and lock it with my lock.</li>
  <li>Now nobody can open that box except me, so you send it through the post.</li>
  <li>It arrives and I use my private key to open my lock.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the world of cryptography, the padlock is called the "public key" because it is out in the open (public) and only a single private key will unlock anything protected by it.</p>

<p>Also, in cryptography a "key" is just a very large number. So we have a public very large number, and a private very large number.</p>

<h3>So is there some sort of link between the public and private keys ?</h3>

<p>Yes. With the private key you can work out the public key, but you can't go backwards.</p>

<p>Keep your private keys secret, keep them safe.</p>

<h3>Thanks, Gandalf. Now you're going to tell me that the Bitcoin address is a public key ?</h3>

<p>Almost. Since the public key is a very large number it is compressed (like zipping up a file) to reduce the space on the blockchain. The compression process also hides the public key which comes in handy later.</p>

<p>That compressed version is the Bitcoin address.</p>

<h3>And how does this help with authorising transactions ?</h3>

<p>This is the final piece of the Bitcoin puzzle. The private key is used to sign transactions.</p>

<h3>Like signing a credit card payment slip ?</h3>

<p>Yes, except it cannot be forged.</p>

<h3>OK, what is being signed then ?</h3>

<p>A Bitcoin transaction is made up of inputs coming from earlier transactions that gave you bitcoins. Those earlier transactions have outputs that point to your addresses.</p>

<h3>So I'm signing something to prove I own the addresses ?</h3>

<p>Exactly. When you create a new transaction you gather up the unspent outputs from various parent transactions to make up the money you need.</p>

<h3>Er, gathering up unspent outputs ?</h3>

<p>Yes. Imagine you have received 1.5 bitcoins each from 10 different sources giving a total of 15 XBT spread over 10 outputs.</p>

<p>You need to pay a bill of 4 XBT so you gather up 3 outputs totalling 4.5 XBT. You create 2 outputs: the first for 4 XBT to cover the bill; the second for 0.5 XBT which you send to an address that you own as "change".</p>

<h3>OK, I understand the inputs and outputs, but where does this "programmable money" come in ?</h3>

<p>You need to produce the public key associated with each address for the outputs. You'll remember that it was hidden behind some compression so only you have it to hand the first time it gets used.</p>

<p>With that public key out in the open anyone can now verify that it correctly compresses to the named address. So far so good - you've proved that you own the address, but now that public key is public knowledge. What if you've used that address before?</p>

<p>Enter the private key. You sign the overall transaction with the private keys for each of the involved addresses to give conclusive proof that you own the address and that you authorise the spending of the contents.</p>

<h3>My head is spinning - how much of this do I need to know to use Bitcoin ?</h3>

<p>Actually very little, but often people want to really understand what they are using. It helps to know what is going on under the covers at a basic level.</p>

<h3>That was basic! Are you kidding me ?</h3>

<p>This is the amazing thing about Bitcoin. There is a huge amount to learn. We haven't even started on the economic theory behind it yet.</p>

<h3>I'm going for a coffee... OK, I'm back - economic theory it is.</h3>
