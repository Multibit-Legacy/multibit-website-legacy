<h2>How to run MultiBit Classic from a USB drive</h2>

<strong>Note: Running your wallet from a USB drive is NOT recommended</strong>

<p>Before doing this, please consider that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>writing critical data to removable drives can be problematic due to users pulling them out leading to corrupted wallet files</li>
  <li>the failure rate for USB drives is much higher than fixed disks when you take into account losses and breakages etc</li>
  <li>it is too easy to lose track of where the wallet files are located - fixed locations are easy to identify</li>
</ul>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Installing MultiBit Classic to run on a USB drive for Windows.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Insert your USB drive into your PC.</li>
  <li>Run the MultiBit Classic Windows installer. On the screen with the question "Select the installation path:" click on the
    "Browse" button and select a directory on your USB drive.
  </li>
  <li>Run the rest of the installation as normal.</li>
  <li>Once the installation is done, in Explorer navigate to your USB drive's MultiBit Classic installation directory. It is the
    directory with the "multibit-classic.exe" file.
  </li>
  <li>Create a new text file called (exactly) "multibit.properties". Leave the file empty.
    This is the MultiBit Classic configuration file. Having a copy in the installation directory (rather than the user's
    application data) tells MultiBit Classic to run locally.
  </li>
  <li>To run MultiBit Classic locally, double click on the multibit-classic.exe file.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will have a single default wallet created, called multibit.wallet. You can create new ones using the 'Create
  Wallet' button and doing a save into your USB drive. You will be using a locally stored block chain (called
  multibit.spvchain).</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>Installing MultiBit Classic to run on a USB drive for Linux.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Insert your USB drive into your Linux machine.</li>
  <li>Run the MultiBit Classic Linux installer. On the screen with the question "Select the installation path:" click on the
    "Browse" button and select a directory on your USB drive.
  </li>
  <li>Run the rest of the installation as normal.</li>
  <li>Once the installation is done, navigate to your USB drive's MultiBit Classic installation directory. It is the directory
    with the "multibit-exe.jar" file.
  </li>
  <li>Create a new text file called (exactly) "multibit.properties". Leave the file empty.
    This is the MultiBit Classic configuration file. Having a copy in the installation directory (rather than the user's
    application data) tells MultiBit Classic to run locally.
  </li>
  <li>To run MultiBit Classic locally, double click on the multibit-exe.jar. If this does not start up the jar file, open a
    command line to your installation directory and run "java -jar multibit-exe.jar".
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Mac</h3>
<p>On a Mac, copy the entire MultiBit Classic application onto your USB drive. The name of the application file will be
  MultiBit Classic.app. Then go to where your wallets are stored and copy the files multibit.properties and
  multibit.spvchain onto your USB drive into the same directory. You can then double click the MultiBit Classic.app
  on your USB drive to run MultiBit Classic</p>
<h3>Notes and Limitations</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The path of the wallets in the configuration file contains the USB drive letter which may change according to how
    many other drives you have plugged in. In this case the wallets other than multibit.wallet will not be found when
    MultiBit Classic opens. You can just use the "Open Wallet" button to load them.
  </li>
  <li>With the instructions above, it assumes you have Java installed on the machine you plug into. You can also have a
    "Java Runtime Environment" stored on the USB too so that it is guaranteed to run. (More details to follow).
  </li>
  <li>The installer will add some shortcuts for running MultiBit Classic pointing to the USB drive. These will not work if the
    USB drive is removed.
  </li>
</ol>
