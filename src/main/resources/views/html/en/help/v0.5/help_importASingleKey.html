<h2>How to import a single private key</h2>
<p>You can import a single private key into MultiBit Classic that you have produced externally, perhaps by vanitygen or
  www.bitaddress.org.</p>

<p>The easiest way to get the format exactly right is:
<ol>
  <li>Create a new wallet saved to a file, say, example.wallet.</li>
  <li>Export the private keys, WITHOUT A PASSWORD, to a file example.key.</li>
  <li>Open up the key file in a text editor. There is a big comment at the top that describes the format. It is simply
    lines, each line containing the sipa format key - beginning with 5 - and the key creation date in a particular
    format. You will have an example in there to copy as a new wallet has one key in it.
  </li>
  <li>Add in your new key and a date a bit before when you created it.</li>
  <li>Import the key file back into the wallet.</li>
  <li>MultiBit Classic will then replay the blocks to get the transactions and work out the balance.</li>
</ol>
<p>TIDY UP: It is good idea to then secure delete the key file so it is not lying around. If you want a quick key backup
  you can do another key export but add a password so that the key export file is encrypted.</p>
