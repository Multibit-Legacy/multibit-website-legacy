<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>You can often diagnose a problem with MultiBit Classic by looking at the Messages window by selecting the 'View |
  <img width="16" height="16" title="Messages" alt="Messages" src="/images/en/v0_5/comment.png"/>&nbsp;Messages'
  menu option.</p>
<p>For a more detailed description of what has happened with MultiBit Classic there is a log file to look at. This is stored in
  the 'log' directory in your user data directory and is called 'multibit.log'. Use a simple text viewer like Notepad or TextEdit to read it.</p>

<h3>Where MultiBit Classic stores your data</h3>
<p>MultiBit Classic stores user specific data such as logs and the default multibit.wallet in a "user data directory". This directory can be worked out as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check the the very top of the "Messages" tab for a message like "The user data directory is '/Users/example/Library/Application Support/MultiBit'"</li>
  <li>Navigate to the MultiBit Classic installation directory and check for a file called "multibit.properties". If there is, use this directory as
    the user data directory. This is for backwards compatibility and for running everything from a USB drive.
  </li>
  <li>If none of these reveal the answer, use the technical approach given below.</li>
</ol>
