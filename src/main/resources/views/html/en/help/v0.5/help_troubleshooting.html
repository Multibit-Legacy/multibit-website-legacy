<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>You can often diagnose a problem with MultiBit by looking at the Messages window by selecting the 'View |
  <img width="16" height="16" title="Messages" alt="Messages" src="/images/en/v0_5/comment.png"/>&nbsp;Messages'
  menu option.</p>
<p>For a more detailed description of what has happened with MultiBit there is a log file to look at. This is stored in
  the 'log' directory in your user data directory and is called 'multibit.log'. Use a simple text viewer like Notepad or TextEdit to read it.</p>

<h3>Where MultiBit stores your data</h3>
<p>MultiBit stores user specific data such as logs and the default multibit.wallet in a "user data directory". This directory can be worked out as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check the the very top of the "Messages" tab for a message like "The user data directory is '/Users/jim/Library/Application Support/MultiBit'"</li>
  <li>Navigate to the MultiBit installation directory and check for a file called "multibit.properties". If there is, use this directory as
    the user data directory. This is for backwards compatibility and for running everything from a USB drive.
  </li>
  <li>If none of these reveal the answer, use the technical approach given below.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Technical approach</h3>
<p>This section is for technical users proficient with accessing environment variables. These are enclosed in "[]" such that [APPDATA] references the APPDATA environment variable.</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Try one of the following locations, remembering that you may need to enable hidden directories</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>[APPDATA]/MultiBit</code>. Windows (7,8): <code>C:\Documents and Settings\jim\AppData\Roaming\MultiBit</code>
  <li><code>[APPDATA]/MultiBit</code>. Windows (XP and below): <code>C:\Documents and Settings\jim\Application Data\MultiBit</code>
</ul>

<h3>Mac</h3>
<p>In OSX the user Library directory is normally hidden. Follow the <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2009/02/25/show-hidden-files-in-os-x/">show hidden files</a> instructions to reveal it in the Finder.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>[user.home]/Library/Application Support/MultiBit</code>. OSX 10.5+: <code>/Users/jim/Library/Application Support/MultiBit</code>
</ul>

<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>In Linux the user home directory is normally visible.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>[user.home]/MultiBit</code>. Ubuntu/Debian: <code>/home/jim/MultiBit</code>
</ul>
