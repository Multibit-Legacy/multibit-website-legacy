<h2>Sign and Verify Message</h2>
<p>(Coming in version 0.5.11.) You can use Bitcoin technology to sign messages. By signing a message and sending it to a recipient they can verify that the message came from you and was not changed in transit. (If you are familiar with signing emails it is quite similar).

<p><b>Sign Message</b></p>
<p>You sign a message using a specific receiving address in a wallet. The recipient needs to know the address you signed your message with when they verify it. To sign a message:</p>
<ol>
    <li><p>Select the wallet in the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Wallets" alt="Wallets" src="/images/en/v0_5/yourWallets.png"/>&nbsp;Wallets' panel that contains your signing address.</p></li>    
    <li><p>Choose the menu option 'Tools | <img width="16" height="16" title="Sign Message" alt="Sign Message" src="/images/en/v0_5/messageSign.png"/>&nbsp;Sign Message'.</p></li>
    <li><p>If your wallet is encrypted, enter the wallet password in the field labeled 'Wallet password'.</p></li>
    <li><p>Enter the receiving address you are using to sign in the 'Address' field.</p></li>
    <li><p>Enter the message you want to sign in the 'Message' field. Every character is part of the signed message, including spaces, tabs and line breaks.</p></li>   
    <li><p>Press the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Sign Message" alt="Sign Message" src="/images/en/v0_5/messageSign.png"/>&nbsp;Sign Message' button. The signature text will appear in the 'Signature' field and you will see a success message when this completes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Send the message, the signature and the signing address to your recipient so that they can verify your message.</p>
<br/>
<p>If you want to remove any sensitive information, you can use the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Clear All" alt="Clear All" src="/images/en/v0_5/delete.png"/>&nbsp;Clear All' button to clear all of the text on the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Sign Message" alt="Sign Message" src="/images/en/v0_5/messageSign.png"/>&nbsp;Sign Message' tab.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Verify Message</b></p>
<p>To verify a message someone sends you:</p>
<ol>
    <li><p>Choose the menu option 'Tools | <img width="16" height="16" title="Verify Message" alt="Verify Message" src="/images/en/v0_5/messageVerify.png"/>&nbsp;Verify Message'.</p></li>
    <li><p>Enter the address that was used to sign the message in the 'Address' field.</p></li>
    <li><p>Enter the message that was signed that you want to verify in the 'Message' field. Pay particular attention to spaces before and after the text - the text must be exact for it to verify correctly.</p></li>
    <li><p>Enter the signature given to you in the 'Signature' field.</p></li>
    <li><p>Press the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Verify Message" alt="Verify Message" src="/images/en/v0_5/messageVerify.png"/>&nbsp;Verify Message' button. Just below this button you will see the result of whether the message is verified or not.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have verified your message you can use the the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Clear All" alt="Clear All" src="/images/en/v0_5/delete.png"/>&nbsp;Clear All' button to clear all of the text on the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Verify Message" alt="Verify Message" src="/images/en/v0_5/messageVerify.png"/>&nbsp;Verify Message' tab.
