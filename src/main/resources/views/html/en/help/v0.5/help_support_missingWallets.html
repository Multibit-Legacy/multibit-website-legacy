<h2>I opened MultiBit and my wallets were missing</h2>
<h3>What are the symptoms ?</h3>
<p>You open MultiBit and instead of seeing your wallet(s) in the Wallet list, you don't see anything. The wallet(s) have probably just been closed.</p>

<h3>What can you do when this happens ?</h3>

<p>Relax - you are very likely to still have your wallet(s) on your disk. Do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Review <a href="help_troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a>. This describes where MultiBit stores the default wallet (multibit.wallet) for your computer.</li>
  <li>Have a look in that directory. You can open any wallet there using the 'File |
    <img width="16" height="16" title="Open Wallet" alt="Open Wallet" src="/images/en/v0_5/openWallet.png"/>&nbsp;Open Wallet' menu option.
  </li>
  <li>Use your computer's search tool to find ".wallet" and <strong>include hidden directories</strong> - you should see the automatically generated backups. </li>
  <li>If you created a new wallet and stored it in another directory then you will have to look there.</li>
  <li>Check any external/network drives you may have chosen when saving the wallet</li>
</ol>
