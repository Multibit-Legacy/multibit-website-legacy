<h2>I sent bitcoin to MultiBit but they never arrived</h2>
<h3>What is the symptom ?</h3>
<p>You sent some bitcoin to MultiBit but the bitcoin never arrived. There is no record of the transaction in MultiBit.</p>

<h3>What can you do about it ?</h3>
<p>The <strong>first thing to check</strong> is whether the bitcoin was actually sent ok. You can do this as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Request the transaction id from the person or company that sent it to you.</li>
  <li>Check the transaction on <a href="https://blockchain.info" target="_blank">Blockchain.info</a> or <a href="http://blockexplorer.com" target="_blank">Bitcoin Block Explorer</a> to be sure that it is actually on the Bitcoin network.</li>
</ol>

<h3>I've verified that the transaction is on the blockchain and it's confirmed</h3>
<p>To get the missing transaction into your wallet:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the wallet in the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Wallets" alt="Wallets" src="/images/en/v0_5/yourWallets.png"/>&nbsp;Wallets' side panel to make it the active wallet.</li>
  <li>Go into the 'Tools | <img width="16" height="16" title="Reset" alt="Reset" src="/images/en/v0_5/resetTransactions.png"/>&nbsp;Reset Blockchain and Transactions' menu option.</li>
  <li>Click on the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Reset" alt="Reset" src="/images/en/v0_5/resetTransactions.png"/>&nbsp;Reset blockchain and transactions' button and let MultiBit sync the blockchain. Just leave MultiBit to work its way through the sync.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should then see the transaction in your wallet.</p>

<h3>I'm running an old version of MultiBit (before 0.5.16)</h3>
<p>Earlier versions of MultiBit did not show transactions that had inputs that were not confirmed. As this caused confusion this has been changed in version 0.5.16 so that these transactions are shown (unconfirmed). If you have an old version of MultiBit download the latest copy and install it. You will need to do a '<img width="16" height="16" title="Reset" alt="Reset" src="/images/en/v0_5/resetTransactions.png"/>&nbsp;Reset blockchain and transactions' so that MultiBit can resync to see any transactions like this.</p>
