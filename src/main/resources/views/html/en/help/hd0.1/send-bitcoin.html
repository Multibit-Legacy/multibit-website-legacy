<p>To send bitcoin to someone click on the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Send" alt="Send" src="/images/en/v0_5/sendOut.png"/>&nbsp;Send' tab (you
  can also use the 'Trade | <img width="16" height="16" title="Send" alt="Send" src="/images/en/v0_5/sendOut.png"/>&nbsp;Send Bitcoin' menu option).</p>

<h4>General procedure</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Enter the destination address (e.g <a href="bitcoin:1AhN6rPdrMuKBGFDKR1k9A8SCLYaNgXhty?amount=0.01&label=Please%20donate%20to%20multibit.org">1AhN6rPdrMuKBGFDKR1k9A8SCLYaNgXhty</a> for MultiBit donations)</li>

<p>At this point if you click send MultiBit will show a confirmation screen giving you the chance to back out. If you proceed then your transaction will
  be submitted to the Bitcoin network and should be considered irreversible from this point on.</p>

<h4>Details</h4>
<p>The Bitcoin network requires you to specify the destination address. Any of the following will work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Type in the destination address directly.</li>
  <li>Copy the destination address to the system clipboard and then click on the "<img width="16" height="16" title="Paste"
                                                                                       alt="Paste" src="/images/en/v0_5/paste.png"/>&nbsp;Paste"
    button next to the address field to paste it in.
  </li>
  <li>Select a previously used destination address from the list shown at the bottom of the panel.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop a Bitcoin QR code onto the existing QR code or "Drag QR code here" text on the right of the panel.</li>
  <li>Paste in a previously copied Bitcoin URI text or bitcoin QR code by using the "<img width="16" height="16"
                                                                                          title="Paste" alt="Paste"
                                                                                          src="/images/en/v0_5/paste.png"/>&nbsp;Paste"
    button on the right hand side panel.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Add in the amount of bitcoin you want to send in the "Amount" field. You can type an amount denominated in bitcoin
  (BTC) in the left entry field or the amount in your fiat currency in the right entry field. MultiBit will perform a currency conversion using
  your choice of exchange.</p>
<p> You should add a label for your personal records in the "Label" field.</p>

<p>You always get a confirmation screen before your bitcoin are actually sent. Click on the "<img width="16" height="16"
                                                                                                  title="Send"
                                                                                                  alt="Send"
                                                                                                  src="/images/en/v0_5/sendOut.png"/>&nbsp;Send"
  button to see this screen. Then:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Check the details on this confirmation screen to make sure the address and amount are correct.</p></li>
  <li><p>Press the "<img width="16" height="16" title="Send" alt="Send" src="/images/en/v0_5/sendOut.png"/>&nbsp;Send" button to
    actually send the bitcoin.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When the bitcoin are sent, you get a message at the bottom of the confirmation screen. Also, the number of peers (other computers on the Bitcoin
  network) that you are connected to that have seen the transaction is shown. If there was a problem in sending your bitcoin an error
  message will be shown instead.</p>
