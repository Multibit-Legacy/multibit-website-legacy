<h2>Importing private keys</h2>
<p>If you have a MultiBit private keys export file you can reimport them into a MultiBit wallet.</p>
<p>To import the private keys into a wallet, do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>In the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Wallets" alt="Wallets" src="/images/en/v0_4/yourWallets.png"/>&nbsp;Wallets'
    side panel choose the wallet you want to import the private keys into.</p></li>
  <li><p>Select the menu option 'Tools | <img width="16" height="16" title="Import private keys"
                                              alt="Import private keys" src="/images/en/v0_4/importKey.png"/>&nbsp;Import
    Private Keys'. The '<img width="16" height="16" title="Import private keys" alt="Import private keys"
                             src="/images/en/v0_4/importKey.png"/>&nbsp;Import Private Keys' screen appears.</p></p><p>
    Here is a screenshot:</p>

            src="/images/en/v0_4/importPrivateKeys.png"/></p></li>
  <li><p>Choose the private key file to import by clicking on the 'Choose import file' button. A file chooser opens and
    you can select the file you want to import. You can also import blockchain.info wallet backup files by changing the
    file type in the 'File format' drop down combobox. </p></li>
  <li><p>If the import file is not password protected, the file is read and the number of keys and replay date for the
    file are shown. If the file is password protected, enter the password in the 'Password' field and press 'Unlock' to
    see the same information. If you have selected a double encrypted blockchain.info wallet backup a second password
    field will appear. Enter your second password and press 'Unlock' once more.</p></li>
  <li><p>To import the private keys to the wallet specified, click on the button '<img width="16" height="16"
                                                                                       title="Import private keys"
                                                                                       alt="Import private keys"
                                                                                       src="/images/en/v0_4/importKey.png"/>&nbsp;Import
    private keys'. When the import of the private key file is successful a message appears.</p>

    <p>If the import of the private key file fails for any reason the error message is given on screen.</li>
  <li><p>After the import, MultiBit then replays the block chain from the replay date to find the transactions for the
    new private keys. For blockchain.info wallets the block chain must be replayed from the first block. This can take up
    to two hours on a wifi connection (depending on the speed of the computer you connect to). It is best just to leave
    MultiBit to sync the block chain on its own.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Import private keys from the reference client</h2>
<p>This is not supported in v0.4.x. The easiest way to achieve it is to simply perform a standard Bitcoin transaction to
  the address provided by MultiBit.</p>
