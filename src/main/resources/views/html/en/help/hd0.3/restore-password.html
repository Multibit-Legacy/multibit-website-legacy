<h3>Restore password</h3>

<p>If you forget your wallet password, then you can restore your password from your wallet words.</p>

<h4>I have my wallet words to hand</h4>

<p>You must keep your wallet words safe, because <strong>anyone</strong> who knows your wallet words can restore your wallet, and steal your bitcoin.</p>

<p>Avoid exposing your wallet words in a public place which may have high definition surveillance cameras present.</p>

<p>The procedure is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start MultiBit HD and click Restore from the Unlock screen</li>
  <li>Select "I have forgotten my password" and click Next</li>
  <li>Select the wallet type (e.g. MultiBit HD or Trezor) from the drop down list</li>
  <li>Enter your wallet words exactly as you wrote them down (order is important)</li>
  <li>Observe a "Verified" message when you have completed the list</li>
  <li>Click Next</li>
  <li>Observe a short delay while your password is extracted then displayed</li>
  <li>Click Finish to return to the Unlock screen</li>
</ol>

<h4>I've lost my wallet words is there anything I can do ?</h4>

<p>If you have really, truly lost or forgotten both your password and your wallet words then it is likely that you have lost access to your bitcoin.</p>

<p>There is <strong>absolutely no way</strong> that the MultiBit team can possibly recover them.</p>

<p>You should keep the encrypted wallet files safe just in case inspiration strikes and you somehow remember the password or the location of your wallet words.</p>

<p>At this point your only hope is that you still have control of the wallet and all you need to do is find your password. There are several possibilities to explore:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure that you are using the most recent password you know</li>
  <li>Try combinations - change one character at a time to upper- or lowercase, swap characters, add a ! to the end and so on</li>
  <li>If the password uses non-English characters consider the effect of the local language mis-coding them</li>
  <li>Capitalisation works differently in non-English locales, such as Turkey.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a last resort go to a quiet room and relax. Think about where you might have put a copy of your wallet words or password. Perhaps one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hidden file somewhere?</li>
  <li>USB drive?</li>
  <li>Encrypted copy held on LastPass or KeePass? You should be using a secure password generator with 14 or more random characters.</li>
  <li>Accidental copy on a local backup service like Time Machine or rsync?</li>
  <li>An intentional encrypted copy on SpiderOak, Dropbox or GDrive?</li>
  <li>Maybe you wrote it down and put it in a book, or an old drawer?</li>
  <li>Does a trusted friend or relative have a copy?</li>
</ul>
