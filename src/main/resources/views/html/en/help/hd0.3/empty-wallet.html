<h3>Empty Wallet</h3>

<p>To send all your bitcoin to just one Bitcoin address, select "Manage wallet" and then select "Empty wallet".</p>

<ol>
  <li>Enter the address you want to send all your Bitcoin to in the "Recipient" box (or use the dropdown to select a recipient from your <a href="contacts.html">contacts</a>). </li>
  <li>Enter your wallet password and click "Next". MultiBit HD will then show a confirmation screen giving you a last chance to back out. If you proceed then MultiBit HD will
    submit a transaction to the Bitcoin network which should be considered irreversible. Your wallet will be emptied and your balance will be nil.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Some additional information</h4>

<p>Occasionally, the "Empty wallet" icon is greyed out for a few seconds, while MultiBit HD connects to the Bitcoin network. If the "Empty wallet" icon stays greyed out,
  you can fix it by <a href="repair-wallet.html">repairing your wallet</a>.</p>
<p>You can track your "Empty wallet" transaction along with all your other payments in the <a href="payments.html">payments</a> screen.
