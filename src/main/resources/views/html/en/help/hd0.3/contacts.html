<h3>Contacts</h3>

<p>To keep your own list of contacts within your wallet, select "Contacts" from the sidebar.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select "Add" to get a new contact form.</li>
  <li>Enter any of the contact's name, email address, bitcoin address.</li>
  <li>Enter any tags that you want to group your contacts by.</li>
  <li>Enter any private notes about the contact.</li>
  <li>Click "Apply" to add the contact to your list.</li>
  <li>You can always edit or delete a contact by coming back to the "Contacts" screen.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Some additional information</h4>

<p>If your contact has registered an avatar against their email address at <a href="http://www.gravatar.com" target="_blank">Gravatar</a>, the avatar will appear after you enter their email address.</p>

<p>Contacts with a valid bitcoin address will appear (by name) in the dropdown address box if you want to <a href="send-bitcoin.html">send a payment</a> or <a href="empty-wallet.html">empty your wallet</a>.</p>

<p>You may prefer <em>not</em> to store a fixed bitcoin address against any contact, as there are pros and cons to using bitcoin addresses more than once.  For example, the <a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1AhN6rPdrMuKBGFDKR1k9A8SCLYaNgXhty"  target="_blank">MultiBit donation address</a> has been used many times, but MultiBit HD <a href="request-bitcoin.html">generates a new receiving address</a> each time you request a payment.</p>
