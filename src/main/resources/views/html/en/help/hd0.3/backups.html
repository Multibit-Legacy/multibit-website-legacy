<h3>Wallet backups</h3>

<p><strong>You can always recover your bitcoin <a href="restore-wallet.html">through your wallet words (seed phrase).</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>So long as you know your wallet words</strong> (or your Trezor and PIN if you are using one) you can use a wallet backup to <a href="restore-wallet.html">recover</a>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>your bitcoin</li>
  <li>your contacts and notes</li>
  <li>your payment history and notes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hardware and software can fail, be lost or stolen. MultiBit HD ensures that an automatic encrypted backup is made of your wallet
  to a location that you specify.</p>

<h4>Use a cloud backup service</h4>

<p>Setting up a cloud backup service is straightforward and for small amounts of data (under 2GB) it is often free. We would strongly
  urge you to consider <a href="https://spideroak.com" target="_blank">SpiderOak</a> for its end to end encryption. An alternative is Dropbox which is extremely
    common and provides an excellent user experience.</p>
<p>MultiBit HD encrypts all your cloud backup information using a strong AES key derived from either your wallet words or from a password provided by your Trezor. It is safe to
  store in the cloud without worrying about bad people being able to read your data.</p>

<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>MultiBit HD maintains three stages of wallet backup:</p>
<ul>
  <li>rolling backup - these are recent copies of your wallet. They are encrypted with your wallet password / Trezor provided password</li>
  <li>local backup - this is a zip of the wallet directory (less block chain) encrypted with a key derived from the wallet words or from your Trezor provided password. It is stored
    locally on your machine
  </li>
  <li>cloud backup - this is a zip of the wallet directory (less block chain) encrypted with a key derived from the wallet words or from your Trezor provided password. It is copied
    to your cloud backup directory
  </li>
</ul>

<p>More information on the scheduling of these backups is given later.</p>

<h4>Encrypting "soft" wallets and their backups</h4>

<p>A "soft" wallet is one that is not linked to an external hardware device such as a <a href="https://buytrezor.com?a=multibit.org" target="_blank">Trezor</a>.</p>

<p>The rolling backups encrypt a snapshot of the current wallet. Rolling backups are loaded automatically if the load of the primary wallet fails. The user is told if a rolling
  backup is loaded on the 'Wallet startup' screen after unlock. The rolling backup is AES-256 encrypted using a key derived from the user's password after running it through
  Scrypt (N=16384, r=8, p=1). Interested readers <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt.pdf" target="_blank">should refer to the Scrypt white paper (PDF)</a> for more
  details if brute force or dictionary attacks are a concern (in particular pages 12-14).</p>

<p>When making a local or cloud backup we zip up the wallet directory and include the wallet password in encrypted form in the archive. Short wallet passwords are padded. The zip
  file is then encrypted using a key derived from the wallet words. This approach allows the password to be recovered from a cloud backup so long as the user knows the wallet words.</p>

<p>It also means that cloud backups are safe for long term off-site storage.</p>

<h4>Encrypting "hard" wallets and their backups</h4>

<p>A "hard" wallet is one that is linked to an external hardware device such as a Trezor. They provide much greater protection for your bitcoins because the
  private keys are never present on your desktop machine and are not susceptible to malware or viruses.</p>

<p>After entering the Trezor PIN the password for your Trezor wallet is provided by the Trezor encrypting a fixed phrase in a deterministic manner. This password is also used to
  encrypt your cloud backups.</p>

<p>Therefore the only way to unlock either the wallet or the backups is to physically have the correct Trezor present and to know its PIN.</p>

<h4>Managing all the backups</h4>

<p>MultiBit HD maintains a comprehensive backup strategy consisting of rolling, local and cloud backups. While technical in nature
  interested readers may find the following information helpful.</p>

<p>After successfully unlocking a wallet MultiBit HD will follow this process to maintain backups:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Wait 1 minute after MultiBit HD starts and then start "ticking" every 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Every "tick" (2 minutes), create a rolling wallet backup. This is a copy of the encrypted wallet stored in the
    wallet's <code>rolling-backup</code> sub-directory. It is timestamped and encrypted with the wallet password.
    There are up to 4 of these in place covering the last 8 minutes of activity.
  </li>
  <li>Every "tick modulo 5" (10 minutes), create a zip backup in the wallet <code>zip-backup</code> directory. These
    are the local zip backups. This is everything in the wallet directory except the blockstore (always retrievable from
    the Bitcoin network) and the zip-backups themselves. Note that the rolling backups are put in the zip backup.
    It is a zip file which is then AES encrypted using a strong key derived from your wallet words or from a password provided by your Trezor.
  </li>
  <li>Every "tick modulo 15" (30 minutes), copy the just created zip backup to the cloud backup directory if one has
    been set.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rolling backups are made at 1, 3, 5, 7 ... minutes after start up</li>
  <li>Local zip backups at 1, 11, 21, 31, 41 ... minutes after start up</li>
  <li>Cloud zip backups at 1, 31, 61, 91 ... minutes after start up</li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid excessive unnecessary data storage the rolling backups are pruned, oldest first, when there are more than 4
  backups using a secure delete mechanism.</p>

<p>The local and cloud zip backups are pruned when there are more than 60 using the following process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first 2 are always kept</li>
  <li>The last 8 are always kept</li>
  <li>For the remaining, the backup that was most rapidly replaced is secure deleted</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach gradually spaces out the backups so that there is protection for the most recent changes and also the
  ability to go all the way back to the beginning if necessary.</p>

<h4>What about storing wallets directly on USB keys ?</h4>

<p>MultiBit HD does not support changing the location of where wallets are stored.</p>

<p>This is by design. We found that the seemingly straightforward option of letting users choose where to put their wallet,
  including on removable media such as USB drives (IronKeys and so forth), created a whole host of subtle problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>writing critical data to removable drives can be problematic due to users pulling them out leading to corrupted wallet files</li>
  <li>the failure rate for USB drives is much higher than fixed disks when you take into account losses and breakages etc</li>
  <li>it is too easy to lose track of where the wallet files are located - fixed locations are easy to identify</li>
</ul>

<p>Using a removable drive introduces a single point of failure that invalidates the automatic backups. The rolling
  and local zip backups are co-located with the wallet so if you lose/break your USB drive you've also lost them. By contrast, it would take a
  catastrophic fixed disk failure to prevent access to both the rolling and local zip backups which is much less likely.</p>

<p>Consider also how cloud backups would be set up in this configurable wallet environment. Assuming that a cloud backup folder has been set
  the path/mapping is likely to be different between machines. Consequently by relying on the removable media you run the risk of losing 3 out
  of the 4 possible recovery mechanisms (wallet words being the only remaining one, which won't recover all your contacts, exchange rates etc).</p>

<p>Overall, the failure rate for storing wallets on removable media is too high for the intended user of MultiBit HD so we've chosen
  not to support it for the above safety and security reasons.</p>
