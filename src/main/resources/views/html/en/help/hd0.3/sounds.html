<p>You should be hearing the default system beep. However, it may be turned off by default on your system.</p>

<p>On OS X, select Apple | System Preferences | Sounds. Note that unchecking the "User interface sounds" doesn't disable all sound. However sliding the "Alert Volume" option all
  the way to the left (minimum), together with unchecking the other options will disable the beep.</p>
