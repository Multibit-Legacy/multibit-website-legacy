<h3>Change PIN</h3>

<p>When you have a <a href="https://buytrezor.com/?a=multibit.org" target="_blank">Trezor</a> or <a href="https://www.keepkey.com" target="_blank">KeepKey</a> attached, from the Tools screen select "Change PIN‚Äù.</p>

<p>The Trezor / KeepKey device will show a PIN matrix on its screen. To enter a new PIN you must look at where the digits of your PIN are
  on the Trezor / KeepKey screen and then click the corresponding button on the MultiBit HD screen. This "digit position" technique prevents
  electronic eavesdroppers from discovering your PIN.</p>

<p>You can repeat digits in your PIN and you can make it up to 10 digits long.</p>
