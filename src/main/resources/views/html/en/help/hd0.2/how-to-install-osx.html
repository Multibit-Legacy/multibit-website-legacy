<h3>How to install on OS X (Mac)</h3>

<p>The MultiBit HD installer is slightly different from a standard OS X installer in that it doesn't rely on a single drag and drop into the Applications directory. However, once
  the installer has completed the resulting package in Applications can be dragged to the launch bar as usual.</p>

<h4 id="lion">Requires OS X Lion or higher</h4>

<p>For security reasons MultiBit HD requires OS X 10.7.3 (Lion) or higher. You can get a <a href="https://www.apple.com/osx/how-to-upgrade/"
                                                                                                                target="_blank">free OS X upgrade from the Apple app store</a>.</p>

<p>Bitcoin software requires a secure environment and OS X Lion (released in 2011) is quite old now. We urge you to upgrade to keep your system up to date.</p>
