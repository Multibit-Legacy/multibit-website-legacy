<h2>Using QR codes</h2>
<p>QR codes are the two dimensional bar code that appear on the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Send" alt="Send" src="/images/common/en/v0_4/sendOut.png"/>&nbsp;Send' and '<img width="16" height="16" title="Request" alt="Request" src="/images/common/en/v0_4/receiveIn.png"/>&nbsp;Request' screens.   With these you can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Make it easy for someone else to send you bitcoin.   On the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Request" alt="Request" src="/images/common/en/v0_4/receiveIn.png"/>&nbsp;Request' screen select a receiving address and add a label and the amount of bitcoin you want to be paid.   This creates a QR code in the panel on the right.   Copy it with the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Copy" alt="Copy" src="/images/common/en/v0_4/copy.png"/>&nbsp;Copy' button or drag and drop it into, say, an email message and send it to the payer.</li>
	<li>If you have a QR code, you can drag and drop it onto an existing QR code or the 'Drag QR code here' text on the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Send" alt="Send" src="/images/common/en/v0_4/sendOut.png"/>&nbsp;Send' screen. It is then read and the send form is automatically populated.   You can then press the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Send" alt="Send" src="/images/common/en/v0_4/sendOut.png"/>&nbsp;Send' button as normal to send the payment</li>
	<li>You can copy a QR code into your clipboard and use the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Paste" alt="Paste" src="/images/common/en/v0_4/paste.png"/>&nbsp;Paste' button on the right hand side of the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Send" alt="Send" src="/images/common/en/v0_4/sendOut.png"/>&nbsp;Send' screen to paste it in.</li>
        <li>You can also drag the QR code directly to your desktop and a PNG image file of the QR code is created.</li>
	<li>Some sites, notably www.instawallet.com, provide QR codes of their bitcoin addresses.   You can drag and drop these onto the target in the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Send" alt="Send" src="/images/common/en/v0_4/sendOut.png"/>&nbsp;Send' screen and it will automatically create an entry in your list of sending addresses</li>
</ul>
