<h2>Bitcoin on Reddit</h2>
<p><a href="http://reddit.com/r/bitcoin" target="_blank">/r/bitcoin</a> (the Bitcoin sub-Reddit) is a very popular outlet for news.
  Typically there will be 20-30 articles a day relating to the Bitcoin ecosystem and there is no registration required.</p>
<p>This is the home of the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcointip" target="_blank">Bitcoin Tipping Bot</a> which enables Redditors to send each other
  bitcoins using a simple syntax like:</p>
<pre>+/u/bitcointip 10mBTC</pre>
<p>The above command will send 10mBTC to whoever you are replying to, even if they don't know about Bitcoin.</p>
<p>There are similar services available for Twitter, Facebook and many other social networking sites.</p>
<p>This illustrates the extraordinary flexibility of Bitcoin and how it dovetails neatly with the rest of the Internet's infrastructure.</p>

<h2><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/bitcoin" target="_blank">Twitter Search</a></h2>
<p>Possibly the fastest way to hear about new developments in the Bitcoin world. Simply run the search and trawl the resulting stream. Use "#bitcoin".</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bitcoin-P2P-Cryptocurrency/134466763256650" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a></h2>

<h2><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/" target="_blank">BitcoinTalk Forum</a></h2>
<p>This is the original forum dedicated to discussions about Bitcoin. There is a huge turnover of information and many big names in the Bitcoin community make their voices and opinions heard. They have a substantial section to assist beginners and most breaking news about Bitcoin can be found there first.</p>
<p>There is a dedicated <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=99.0" target="_blank">MultiBit forum.</a>

<h2>Bitcoin on IRC</h2>
